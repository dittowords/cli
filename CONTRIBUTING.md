## Contributing

Hi! Thanks for your interest in contributing to the Ditto CLI!

We accept pull requests for bug fixes and we'd also love to hear about ideas for new features as issues.

## Building the project

Prerequisites:

- Node v20 or above
- yarn (1.x)

To compile and run the cli, use the `yarn start` command. Any additional parameters the CLI accepts can be added. For example:

- `yarn start pull`
- `yarn start --version`

We additionally support the `yarn sync` command which is an alias to `yarn start pull`.
